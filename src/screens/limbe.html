        <p>My name is Ebote Nicoline and I am going to Uppersixth. I am offering 5 subjects and hoping to have an A grade in all 5 subjects by God's grace and I am a student of Saker Baptist College Limbe.</p>
    <p> My ambition here is to learn and make money and I'm guessing .that's one of the many reasons people study programming.</p>

   <p>My name is Monyongo Darren Motale, I am a student of G.B.H.S LIMBE. I actually share thesame ambition as my friend Nico. Without typing my life in here I don't have much to tell you for real. That is why I do not offer literature nor history. I beg please don't cut my head here.
